<h1>Kyle Nelson Developer Notes</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>DevNote 9/16</h2>
<p></p>
Last Wednesday, Defler and I met and created the majority of the project plan together. We submitted it to our customer for tentative approval. This totaled 105 words exactly.
<p></p>
Today I wrote the Title Page, Nonfunctional Requirements, Feasibility, and Conclusion sections of the Requirements Specification document. This totaled 627 words exactly. The Metrics document counted for an additional 138 words exactly. This brings the running tally for the word count to 870 words exactly.
